Explanation of Model Parameters

Each model's parameters are chosen based on their ability to address specific aspects of the problem while maintaining simplicity for an initial implementation. Here's a breakdown:

---

1. Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
- Kernel: Default ('rbf') — Radial Basis Function kernel is versatile and works well for non-linear problems.
- Random State: 42 — Ensures reproducibility.

SVC is robust for high-dimensional data like audio features, making it a strong candidate for detecting subtle patterns in fake vs. real voices.

2. Naive Bayes
- GaussianNB: Assumes Gaussian distribution of features — suitable for continuous data like normalized audio features.

Naive Bayes is computationally efficient and provides a simple baseline model, useful for comparison. However, its assumption of feature independence may not fully capture complex relationships between audio features.

3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- n_neighbors: 5 — A commonly used value that balances overfitting (too small) and underfitting (too large).

KNN is a non-parametric model that works well with well-scaled data, such as the normalized features. The choice of 5 neighbors provides a balance between stability and sensitivity.

4. Random Forest
- n_estimators: Default — Number of trees in the forest. (The default is typically sufficient unless the dataset is very large.)
- Random State: 42 — For reproducibility.

Random Forest combines decision trees to improve generalization. It's less sensitive to noise and overfitting compared to single decision trees. It is particularly effective in capturing non-linear relationships in the features.

5. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Input Shape: (1, X_train.shape[1]) — Represents a single time step with multiple features.
  - Treating each audio sample as a single time step allows the model to focus on feature correlations.
- LSTM Units: 64 — Balances complexity and training time. Higher values could improve performance but may lead to overfitting on smaller datasets.
- Dropout: 0.5 — Helps prevent overfitting by randomly deactivating 50% of the neurons during training.
- Dense Layer (32 units): Adds complexity to the model to learn abstract patterns.
- Output Layer Activation: softmax — Suitable for multi-class or binary classification (with one-hot encoded labels).

LSTMs are designed for sequence data, but here, they are applied to exploit feature relationships. Dropout layers are included to prevent overfitting, especially given the relatively small dataset.

General Design Principles
1. Baseline Comparisons: Simple models like Naive Bayes establish a baseline for evaluating the effectiveness of more sophisticated models.
2. Regularization: Parameters like Dropout in LSTM help prevent overfitting.
3. Scalability: Parameters are chosen to balance model complexity and training efficiency, suitable for a dataset with 11,778 samples.
4. Reproducibility: Setting random seeds ensures consistent results across runs.

These parameters are selected based on typical recommendations, knowledge of the models, and the structure of the dataset. Fine-tuning through grid search or other optimization techniques can further improve performance.
